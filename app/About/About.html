    This is a small tool I created to assist myself in making timetabling decisions for
    university. It is released publicly with no guarantees about its usefulness for you
    (Please <b>check your timetable</b> against the university website especially if you use the
    automatic parser.

    You can either input the options available for a course manually on the Input page,
    or get the data (closer to) automatically from the UON timetable website. I am aware
    that this solution is far from ideal, but it is the cleanest way I have been able to
    do it so far. If you know of a more direct way to get UON timetable data please do
    let me know.
